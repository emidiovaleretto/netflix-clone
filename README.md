# Netflix-Clone‚Äã :popcorn: :movie_camera:

---

This project is a clone of the Netflix homepage. It was built using the main concepts of HTML5 and CSS3. I tried to apply the maximum of the knowledge acquired during the Bootcamp of Digital Innovation One such as adding others elements to the application (things that haven't been seen during the training) in order to work on my creativity.
